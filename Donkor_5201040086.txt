1. Software process model is an abstract representation of a process. 
It is important because it presents a description of a process from some particular perspective.


2. The waterfall model requires that each process must be completely done before going to another phase. 
This makes it very difficult in changing a step in the process whiles in Agile processes, changes are 
easily done in the course of the process to suit customer's requirements.

In Waterfall model, because one step must be completed before the next step, it helps for the work to be nice and neat.
Agile models are flexible and makes work very fast and very easily done. 

The main drawback of the waterfall model is the difficulty of accommodating changes after the process is underway.
In Agile model too, it is easy to interrupt the process because changes can be done at any point in the modeling.


3. Rational unified process is a modern generic process derived from the work on the UML and it's associated process. 
It differs from other software development process models in such a way that it is derived from already made or existing 
work of the UML and it's associated process.

The key phases are;
I) INCEPTION, it establishes the business case for the system.
II)ELABORATION, it develops understanding of the problem domain and the system architecture.
III)CONSTRUCTION, it is the system design, programming and testing. 
IV) TRANSITION, it deploys the system in it's operating environment.

Benefits of the RUP are;
I) The separation of phases and workflows.
II) The recognition of deploying software in a user's environment is part of the process.

Drawback of the RUP is that;
The RUP is not a suitable process for some types of development, e.g., embedded software 
development can't be very suitable for such process.
